# Understanding the 2020 Presidential Election Polls

Quite a lot has been written about 2016 election forecasts, polls, and the [influence](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~seanjwestwood/papers/aggregator.pdf) they may have had on voter behavior. A good friend and I were also caught up in the [hype around forecast models](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/11/how-will-we-know-if-nate-silver-was-right.html). 

This project is based off of the lessons learned from the 2016 and 2018 elections. The intent is to inform, not influence, the status of the presidential election.
